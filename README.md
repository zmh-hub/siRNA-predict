# siRNA-predict with RNA secondary structure(SPRSS)
Use machine learning to predict siRNA efficacy(LightGBM).

We uploaded our novel system on the web server and it can be accessed for free on the website: http://sbo-bio.com.cn/2007/.

The final prediction program is in the rar file. Run the predictor.py file to input the mRNA sequence and siRNA nucleotide number to get the result.
